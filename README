Build Instructions
-----
Depends on libncurses and the standard POSIX library. libncurses should
be installable with your local package manager - refer to your system's
documentation for details. Once installed, type 'make' to build.

Controls
-----
WASD - Move in the cardinal directions
IJKL - Shoot in the cardinal directions

Notes
-----
This project is *old*, and thus really messy and badly coded.
Putting it out there for anyone interested.
